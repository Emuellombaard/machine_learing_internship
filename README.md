# machine learing internship

During my internship I was given the oppertunity to learn about deep learning and work with neural networks.

I started by doing a few courses on machine learning, more specifically neural networks and the different frameworks and API's
which can be used to construct and build these neural networks

I learned a lot about machine learning and how it can be utilized to solve various problems in the real world.
I focused more on convolutional neural networks (or CNN's) and how the different API's compare to each other. The API's that I worked with 
were PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras (built to operate on top of TensorFlow) and H2O.

I built a CNN for an image classifier which I implemented in all four of the above mentioned frameworks, and compared the results each of them produced.
The dataset I used was the imfamous MNIST dataset. For those who do not know what the MNIST dataset is,
it is a dataset of 70 000 images of handwritten digits from 0-9.

60 000 of these images were used as a training set to train the neural network and a set of 10 000 completely new images were used as a test set
to test the classifier.

I noticed a few things...

- To keep your NN from overfitting, use Dropout, otherwise the NN will "get used to trends or memorize the data", in stead of seeing the general trend of things.

- Minimize the model's complexity, keep in mind your size of your cross-validation.

- Frequently check out your training and test error.

Also, I am new to this and am still learning.

I find the field of Machine Learning very interesting and I will continue posting new projects and things I learn and go along.
