# machine learing internship

During my internship I was given the oppertunity to learn about deep learning and work with neural networks.

I started by doing a few courses on machine learning, more specifically neural networks and the different frameworks and API's
which can be used to construct and build these neural networks

I learned a lot about machine learning and how it can be utilized to solve various problems in the real world.
I focused more on neural networks and how the different API's compare to each other. The API's that I worked with 
are PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras and H2O.

I built a convolutional neural network for an image classifier in all four of the above mentioned frameworks and compared them.
The dataset I used was the imfamous MNIST dataset. For those who do not know what the MNIST dataset is,
it is a dataset of 70 000 images of handwritten digits from 0-9.

60 000 images was used as a training set to train the neural network and a set of 10 000 completely new images were used as a test set
to test the classifier.
